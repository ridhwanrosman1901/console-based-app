# Python Console-Based App Project

This is a simple Python console-based application that demonstrates basic functionalities, such as incrementing a counter, performing file and directory operations, and safely dividing two numbers. The project is divided into three modules: `counter`, `file_operations`, and `calculator`.

## Features

- **Counter Module**: Increment and reset a global counter.
- **File Operations Module**: Perform basic file and directory operations.
- **Calculator Module**: Safely divide two numbers with exception handling for division by zero.

## Preview

Below are previews of the different functionalities provided by this application:

### Main Menu

```

### Counter Operations

- **Increment Counter**: Increases the counter by 1 and displays the updated value.
- **Reset Counter**: Resets the counter to 0 and displays the reset value.
- **Show Counter**: Displays the current value of the counter.

5. Delete File 'test_file.txt'
6. Delete Directory 'test_dir'
7. Back to Main Menu
Enter your choice:
```

- **Show Current Directory**: Displays the current working directory and its contents.
- **Create Directory 'test_dir'**: Creates a new directory named 'test_dir'.
- **Change to 'test_dir' Directory**: Changes the working directory to 'test_dir'.
- **Create File 'test_file.txt'**: Creates a new file named 'test_file.txt' inside the current directory.
- **Delete File 'test_file.txt'**: Deletes the file 'test_file.txt' if it exists.
- **Delete Directory 'test_dir'**: Deletes the directory 'test_dir' and changes back to the parent directory.

### Division Calculator

```
Enter a number: [input]
Enter another number: [input]
```

- **Safe Division**: Prompts the user to enter two numbers and performs division with exception handling for division by zero.
